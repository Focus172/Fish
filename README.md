This is an in progress game that lets you walk around a fish market and not much else. There is nothing to see as of now but here are a few comments just in case.

#### Gameplay 

You walk around and talk to people who give you mundane information. I want to emulate real life where you often have the most interesting conversations with people about random things. 

This game is somewhat based off of *Kindergarten* in the sense that it is kinda straight chaos without being a fast based game.

#### Installation

Just pull the code, make sure you have java 17 installed and run it.
